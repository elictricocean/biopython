    by the `UNBOUND`_ constant, which maps to the ``None`` constant
    in Python).
    
    If both the subject and the object term is bound to a specific

    from the Gene Ontology using the standard inference rules or

    The summary of the `Gene Ontology inference rules`_ defines *rules*
    in the following format: "if we know that A is in a given relationship
    R1 with B, and B is in a given relationship R2 with C, then we can
    infer that A is in a given relationship R3 with C". Therefore, our
    rules will be stored in the form of triplets of R1, R2, and R3. For
    instance, the triplet ``("is_a", "is_a", "is_a")`` means the following
    rule: "if A ``is_a`` B and B ``is_a`` C, then A ``is_a`` C". Similarly,
    the triplet ``("regulates", "part_of", "regulates")`` means that
    "if A ``regulates`` B and B ``part_of`` C, then A ``regulates`` C".

    Besides rules, we also have *rule templates*. Rule templates differ
    from rules in the third element of the triplet, which may be either
    of the integer constants 1 or 2. 1 means that R3 is identical to R1,
    whatever R1 is, while 2 means that R3 is identical to R2. This enables
    us to encode all the five relationships where R1 is ``is_a`` as follows:
    ``("is_a", "any", 2)``, meaning that if A ``is_a`` B and B stands in
    an arbitrary relationship R2 with C, then A stands in the very same
    relationship with C.

    The rules and rule templates are stored in the `rules` member variable.
    There is also a class variable called `default_rules`, which contains
    the default inference rules of the Gene Ontology. If you don't supply
    a ruleset at construction time, the default rules will be used.

    Rules must be listen in the order they should be checked for; in other
    words, more specific rules (such as ``("positively_regulates", "is_a",
    "positively_regulates)``) should come before more general rules (such as
    ``("regulates", "inheritable", "regulates")``).
